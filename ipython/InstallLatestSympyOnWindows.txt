To setup latest sympy for python 2.7 with GA in Windows with LaTeX printing -

    1. Go to python.org and download Python 2.7.2 Windows installer

    2. Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.5.1/ and
       download numpy-1.5.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe

    3. Go to http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files and download
       setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe

    4. Go to http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ and download mysysGit

    5. Install MiKTeX or texlive (working installation of latex needed
       with previewer).  GA is setup to use either yap or dviout for
       displaying latex dvi files.

    6. Install Python2.7, Numpy1.5.1, git, and setuptools

    7. Create shortcut to c:msysgit\msysgit\msys.bat and put on desktop.

    8. Open git console (shortcut in step 7) and enter the command
       "git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git"

    9. Move sympy from c:msysgit to location you wish it to be in.

   10. If you wish to replace current sympy version of GA with custom version
       delete directory sympy/sympy/galgebra from github sympy download and
       replace with custom galgebra directory obtained from brombo.

   11. Open command line console in sympy directory and enter commands -
           python setup.py install
           python setupegg.py install

   12. You now have latest development version (main branch) of sympy installed
       with brombo updates to GA (if desired) and LaTeX printing.

   13. If you work with latex documents a lot I suggest you go to
       http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html and download Texmaker.

To install ipython with notebook -

    1. Do following easy_install's from a command line console -
            easy_install pyzmq
            easy_install nose
            easy_install tornado

    2. Open git console and enter command line -
            git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git

    3. Move ipython directory from c:msysgit to desired location

    4. Open command line console in ipython directory and execute -
            python setup.py install
            python setupegg.py install
       Then add C:\Python27\scripts to Path environment variable (this is
       path to ipython.exe so that one can execute ipython with options
       such as "ipython notebook --profile=GA_3D").

    5. Run ipython in command line console with -
            ipython
       This creates .ipython directory which you will modify

    6. Delete all files in .ipython, but not the directory

    7. Copy all files in sympy/sympy/galgebra/ipython directory into .ipython
       directory (this circumlocution is because windows does not
       allow me to rename ipython_config to .ipython)

    8. You can now start ipython notebook with the following command -
            ipython notebook --profile=profile_name
       where profile_name can be -
            GA    - GA, latex_ex, and sympy imports performed
            GA_2D - 2D Euclidian Geometric algebra set up with coords x and y
            GA_3D - 3D Euclidian Geometric algebra set up with coords x, y and z
            GA_ST - 4D Spacetime Geometric algebra set up with coords t, x, y and z
        for GA_2D, GA_3D, and GA_ST tex.Format(redir=False) is called so notebook
        results will be displayed in LaTeX.

Note that in the ipython notebook any line that starts with a '>' will be preprocessed so that
the correct operator precedence for geometric algebra is enforced.
